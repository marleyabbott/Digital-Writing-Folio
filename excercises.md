# Digital Writing
## Exercises
### Week 1 Reflection: 
<p>
On the tram to uni this morning, I wrote this down in my notebook:
'These systems we rely on to run our lives (like Google), are much more fragile than they seem. We believe, because our whole lives are stored and tracked and planned with the systems, that they are permanent, structurally sound, safe. But then someone like Elon Musk can buy Google, ruin it and we will move on to something else. The things that we thought were so permanent and important won't be anymore'.

<em> A repository is like a [container]. A place to store all of the information. All of the language. 
  You push, I pull.
On the phone you said that you still loved me. 
I didn't know if it was the right thing to do, and I don't know the meaning behind this language of symbols, 
  but I told you that I loved you too. </em>
  
I'm not sure what I was expecting today, but the class was a lot more code-orientated than writing-orientated, and I'm wondering when we will discuss the possibilities of expanding our practice in the digital format. I'm feeling intrigued but a little intimidated. My brain doesn't feel wired to do coding. I always struggled with STEM subjects in school, got frustrated, then bored. There's something too black and white about mathematics and science and technology. There is only one right answer (most of the time), and it bores me. I'd be much more interested if I could break the code somehow, break through to something new, if I didn't have to get it right to make it work for the reader. Maybe I don't have to... 

There is something about 'E-lit' that pinches my intestine. I am currently translating words written into my notebook and pasting it into this code. I want to move away from online and move into the real world. Where the words are spoken out loud. The sound travels... echos, it rustles a tree, a tangible thing, a statement that we were here. People listen to a story spoken and something shifts in them. 

But then I think about all of the stories I've read online. How they've shifted something in me. How that is real, that feeling is tangible, and in some ways permanent, accessible, even if the internet is not. 

<em> Are we really producing this amount of carbon emissions for something that can all just disappear? 
CO2 isn't seen, but it's effects are felt. 
E-lit is like a gas, it slips through your fingers but does something permanent to your hands on the way through.</em>

Maybe not knowing how to do this, not knowing how to control the format and language like I normally can will show me something about my writing that I couldn't see before. I feel like I'm feeling my way around in the dark until I commit the changes. And it usually looks different to what I was expecting, but sometimes it looks better.

### Week 2 Reflection: 
<p>
Frustrated at the coding practice, but starting to internally map what a Folio might look like. When choosing photos for our glitch coding playground, my computer brought up images of my familie's village, Santo Todaro in Calabria. It felt like a sign. I opened an old writing project that I never finished about Italy and my heritage. The piece attempted to get near the elusive experience of visiting the village for the first time and not knowing how to speak the language. Being by myself in that small mountainous street. Fumbling my way through conversations, everything felt like a bad translation.

I think that's where I want to go with my folio, that frustration and grief at nearly, but not quite understanding something that I should. Like coding because I grew up in a digital era, or my Italian dialect, because it is who I am. I should know these things. I don't. 

In Glitch when we input the new code for the 'retry' computer error container, all of these memories of bad translations came to me. Those sexual inuendos I didn't mean to make in front of my zio e zia, when I vomited on my first night and tried to explain that I was sick (male) but instead received a giant platter of fruit in return (apple- mela). 

The homecoming, that exhausting day of driving around and around the mountain, nearing the village and then not quite reaching it, the tears that could not be contained when I hugged my relatives who I had never met. Still the thing that stays with me most about that trip to Calabria was the wild boar that groaned a goodbye to me as we drove through the sunset, back to the sea. 

How to make something so analogue, like that deserted little village, make sense in a digital format? My only idea so far is to use 'the tank' (the water tank my mum lived in for a portion of her childhood), as the 'container' for something. Like the containers on glitch that we are coding.

I can see a connection forming between the language of coding and the calabrese dialect. The different knowledges emerging and also the not knowing.
</p>

### Week 3 Reflection: 

I sat down at a cafe on Friday morning and edited my Glitch coding playground. To my surprise, for the first time in this class, I enjoyed the process of coding. Since I have been doing freecodecamp week by week, I can see my understanding of the language and structure of coding expand. With help from GPT, I was able to make some significant changes to the playground, removing containers that didn't make sense to my theme. 

#### What is an algorithm? What is a constraint?
An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules designed to perform a task or solve a problem. It can be as simple as a recipe for baking a cake or as complex as the code behind search engines and artificial intelligence. A constraint is a limitation or condition that must be followed when solving a problem or designing a system. Constraints exist in many areas, including coding, writing, design, and real-world problem-solving.
(from chatGPT) 

#### Can you think of ways you might already be using these in your writing? (e.g., tools, techniques or processes that constrain and sytematise the way you write)?
I use an algorithm to organise my writing life on a program called Notion. My notion stores my yearly writing projects where I can drag and drop them into Rick Rubin's craft stages: seed, experimentation, craft, workshop (my addition), completion and publication. In my Notion software I also keep my artist statement, a monthly lexicon of new words, a calendar with my publication dates and submission close dates, and a 'honey pot' of writing prompts and ideas that I can turn to when in need of inspiration. 

I use constraints in various ways in my practice, from setting boundaries with writing time (One 4 hour+ weekly writing session where my phone stays off and I work on a personal writing project), goals around production of work (last year I completed one writing project a month in aims of building a portfolio for publication), different methodologies or practices I might bring into my work (play when my work feels stale or serious, devotion when I want to commit to completing a piece) and writing prompts or exercises similar to ones we explored in class, in aims of expanding my writing into new territory. 

#### Why were the Oupilo writers so interested in the intersection of maths and literature?
The Oupilo writers were fascinated by the intersection of maths and literature because of the possibilities of creative constraints. When mathematical structures or rules are applied to writing, it can produce unexpected results. 

#### How does algorithmic writing make us think differently about authorship?
In my perspective, algorithmic writing is a means of collaboration, but instead of collaborating with a peer you are collaborating with an algorithm or machine, made by humans. The idea of 'remixing' work certainly blurs the lines between plagiarism and inspiration, which to me feels like a natural consequence of the breadth of writing freely available to interact with on the internet. The analogue version of 'remixing' someone else's work might be the cento poem, which is a poem made up of words from other poets. When thinking about algorithmic writing the book Theory of Colours by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe comes to mind, a book entirely composed of other author's words on theme of colour.

#### Lipograms:

<em> Original text:</em> 
You sit on a rock alongside the river at the bottom of the mountain while Zio pokes his pear tree with a stick. You crawl on the overgrown grass to collect them in a Carrefour bag that he holds open. 
You eat. You press down your wrist. Fuck it- you cry. 
Snot greeting vomit and shit in your gut. Blood on the bedsheets, blood in between teeth. Saltwater creates scales of your palms. Black stains on your feet you’re not sure you’ll ever get out. Purple polka-dotted legs- you scale between male and not male. You pendulum back and forth ten times in an hour.  
Use pen and paper in applying the following processes and constraints. Take a photo of the results or transcribe them and add them to your folio:

##### The letter 'E':

##### Prisoner's Constraint:

<em>Original text:</em>
On the first night there is vomit.
Before the vomit she talks at you in the language you have pretended to understand since the morning at the train station where they picked you up and tossed your bags into the back.  
The couch is made of wooden pellets, covered in thin foam. Foam bubbles up and coats your tongue. 
Before talk there is sugo and melone and formaggio sliced thinly and a bottle of homemade red wine. 
You decline. You retract. You are drunk. 
A woman working in the bar corrects your sentences. You repeat after her. Swirl the words around your mouth. Chew on them, swallow, 
but they come rising back up.  
Bile tainted with track changes. 
You sit on the wooden pellet couch that is covered in a red blanket. You try the acupuncture technique to stop nausea that the remedial massage therapist you used to date taught you. You press down on your right wrist with your left thumb.
She walks in mid-vomit and comforts you with words that feel-are familiar. 
Mid shower, the water runs out. You stand naked in front of the tiny sink rinsing shampoo from your dead ends. 
Outside the bathroom window, a soccer ball is tossed between small dirty soles. 

<em> Lipogram:</em>

### Week 4 Reflection: 

This class has expanded my perspective on what a reader is. If before I thought of a reader as static, I now understand that a reader in E-lit is also an interactor or collaborator, and when having to do actions and make decisions to allow the narrative to unfold, they ‘make the work’. This feels like a profound change in how I view my writing practice and who I create works for. 

For my Folio, I have decided on using my piece called 'The Tank', named after the upside-down water tank my mum lived in for a portion of her childhood after her parents migrated from Calabria, Italy to regional Victoria. I believe using Twine would be the most effective tool to translate this story, so far, because of the illusion of choice a user-reader experiences when interacting with the piece, which mirrors the illusion of choice a migrant experienced in the 60's when moving to Australia, forced to move by poverty and thrust into a different form of poverty in Australia. 

I also like the element of a concealed ending with Twine stories as opposed to traditional writing, where the user-reader is being led down a dark path with no end in sight.

*Archival research into family photographs and artefacts and an interview with my Nonna were conducted before mapping. This gave me provided me with new knowledge on the narrative I am exploring and provided me with an auditory and visual understanding of how I might create the soundscape within the work.*

### Week 6 Reflection: 

See the slide deck on Canvas modules Student Works 2024. These are three successful examples of developed digital works and they are all very different. Critically reflect on these works by asking the same sort of questions as you asked of the case study Ass 1:

**How does it work?**  
<em>House on the Hill</em> is a browser-based interactive fiction work that invites the user/reader to explore a pixelated domestic space using standard keyboard navigation (arrow keys or WASD). The reader interacts with environmental objects and characters, each expanding fragments of a larger narrative. Text appears as though being typed, but the pacing can be controlled manually by the user. This introduces a subtle tension between narrative pacing and player impatience. 

**What does it do?**  
The work constructs a sense of suspense and unease through its audiovisual atmosphere and the fragmented narrative structure. The looping music, combined with pixelated visuals and the soft, muted colour palette, evokes a sense of nostalgia. Interactions (like phone calls and character conversations) offer glimpses into a story of unresolved familial tension. The deliberate ambiguity of the narrative raises questions such as, whose house is this? what happened to cause the protagonist to run away? This compels the user/reader to explore the narrative to it's ending, even though that ending is concealed. 

**How does the reader interact with the piece?**  
<em>House on the Hill</em> asserts a form of narrative co-authorship, where the player’s choices construct their own version of the story. The reader must actively navigate the space and choose which objects or characters to engage with. Crucially, the story does not advance without this interaction, meaning the narrative is entirely contingent on the reader’s movement and decisions. 

**What is conveyed by the digital work?**  
This work is a psychogeographical text, suggested through environmental clues and emotionally charged dialogue. Themes of family dysfunction, loss, and memory are conveyed through both the textual content and the domestic setting. The ambiguity invites multiple interpretation. Paired with the suspension of symbols alluding to something bad happening momentarily, this  strengthens its emotional resonance. 

**How does the digital affordance work with the piece’s themes?**  
Digital affordances—such as non-linear exploration, responsive text, and audio-visual elements —support the central themes of fragmentation and emotional discovery. The game mechanics do not simply house the narrative; they *are* the narrative. Each interaction represents a metaphorical unlocking of memory or meaning. The structure of the work encourages varied pathways through the story, subtly reflecting the subjective and often disjointed nature of memory itself. 

**Does its function deepen the meaning and interpretation of the themes for you as a reader?**  
Yes. The narrative is not fully delivered through text alone; it must be pieced together by the reader, mirroring the emotional labour of complex familial relationships. 

**How does the text change between readings?**  
The work is designed to support variation across readings. While it progresses toward a singular conclusion, the route taken alters the rhythm and emphasis of the experience. Some narrative fragments may be missed entirely depending on the reader’s path, inviting multiple play-throughs of the piece. 

**Movement**  
Movement is essential to the narrative experience. Without reader engagement, the story remains dormant. Movement is not just a visual device—it’s a structural and thematic engine. Kinetic elements—such as blinking cursors, flickering lights, and characters that float or glitch—create a sense of intrigue and immersion. The text is not a thriller story, flat on the page, but an entire world that user/reader's become implicated in when making choices around the narrative direction.
