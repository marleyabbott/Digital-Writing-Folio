## Exercises
### Week 1 Reflection: 
<p>
On the tram to uni this morning, I wrote this down in my notebook:
'These systems we rely on to run our lives (like Google), are much more fragile than they seem. We believe, because our whole lives are stored and tracked and planned with the systems, that they are permanent, structurally sound, safe. But then someone like Elon Musk can buy Google, ruin it and we will move on to something else. The things that we thought were so permanent and important won't be anymore'.

<em> A repository is like a [container]. A place to store all of the information. All of the language. 
  You push, I pull.
On the phone you said that you still loved me. 
I didn't know if it was the right thing to do, and I don't know the meaning behind this language of symbols, 
  but I told you that I loved you too. </em>
  
I'm not sure what I was expecting today, but the class was a lot more code-orientated than writing-orientated, and I'm wondering when we will discuss the possibilities of expanding our practice in the digital format. I'm feeling intrigued but a little intimidated. My brain doesn't feel wired to do coding. I always struggled with STEM subjects in school, got frustrated, then bored. There's something too black and white about mathematics and science and technology. There is only one right answer (most of the time), and it bores me. I'd be much more interested if I could break the code somehow, break through to something new, if I didn't have to get it right to make it work for the reader. Maybe I don't have to... 

There is something about 'E-lit' that pinches my intestine. I am currently translating words written into my notebook and pasting it into this code. I want to move away from online and move into the real world. Where the words are spoken out loud. The sound travels... echos, it rustles a tree, a tangible thing, a statement that we were here. People listen to a story spoken and something shifts in them. 

But then I think about all of the stories I've read online. How they've shifted something in me. How that is real, that feeling is tangible, and in some ways permanent, accessible, even if the internet is not. 

<em> Are we really producing this amount of carbon emissions for something that can all just disappear? 
CO2 isn't seen, but it's effects are felt. 
E-lit is like a gas, it slips through your fingers but does something permanent to your hands on the way through.</em>

Maybe not knowing how to do this, not knowing how to control the format and language like I normally can will show me something about my writing that I couldn't see before. I feel like I'm feeling my way around in the dark until I commit the changes. And it usually looks different to what I was expecting, but sometimes it looks better. 
</p>

### Week 2 Reflection: 
<p>
Frustrated at the coding practice, but starting to internally map what a Folio might look like. When choosing photos for our glitch coding playground, my computer brought up images of my familie's village, Santo Todaro in Calabria. It felt like a sign. I opened an old writing project that I never finished about Italy and my heritage. The piece attempted to get near the elusive experience of visiting the village for the first time and not knowing how to speak the language. Being by myself in that small mountainous street. Fumbling my way through conversations, everything felt like a bad translation.

I think that's where I want to go with my folio, that frustration and grief at nearly, but not quite understanding something that I should. Like coding because I grew up in a digital era, or my Italian dialect, because it is who I am. I should know these things. I don't. 

In Glitch when we input the new code for the 'retry' computer error container, all of these memories of bad translations came to me. Those sexual inuendos I didn't mean to make in front of my zio e zia, when I vomited on my first night and tried to explain that I was sick (male) but instead received a giant platter of fruit in return (apple- mela). 

The homecoming, that exhausting day of driving around and around the mountain, nearing the village and then not quite reaching it, the tears that could not be contained when I hugged my relatives who I had never met. Still the thing that stays with me most about that trip to Calabria was the wild boar that groaned a goodbye to me as we drove through the sunset, back to the sea. 

How to make something so analogue, like that deserted little village, make sense in a digital format? My only idea so far is to use 'the tank' (the water tank my mum lived in for a portion of her childhood), as the 'container' for something. Like the containers on glitch that we are coding.

I can see a connection forming between the language of coding and the calabrese dialect. The different knowledges emerging and also the not knowing.
</p>

### Week 3 Reflection: 

I sat down at a cafe on Friday morning and edited my Glitch coding playground. To my surprise, for the first time in this class, I enjoyed the process of coding. Since I have been doing freecodecamp week by week, I can see my understanding of the language and structure of coding expand. With help from GPT, I was able to make some significant changes to the playground, removing containers that didn't make sense to my theme. 

#### What is an algorithm? What is a constraint?
An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules designed to perform a task or solve a problem. It can be as simple as a recipe for baking a cake or as complex as the code behind search engines and artificial intelligence. A constraint is a limitation or condition that must be followed when solving a problem or designing a system. Constraints exist in many areas, including coding, writing, design, and real-world problem-solving.
(from chatGPT) 

#### Can you think of ways you might already be using these in your writing? (e.g., tools, techniques or processes that constrain and sytematise the way you write)?
I use an algorithm to organise my writing life on a program called Notion. My notion stores my yearly writing projects where I can drag and drop them into Rick Rubin's craft stages: seed, experimentation, craft, workshop (my addition), completion and publication. In my Notion software I also keep my artist statement, a monthly lexicon of new words, a calendar with my publication dates and submission close dates, and a 'honey pot' of writing prompts and ideas that I can turn to when in need of inspiration. 

I use constraints in various ways in my practice, from setting boundaries with writing time (One 4 hour+ weekly writing session where my phone stays off and I work on a personal writing project), goals around production of work (last year I completed one writing project a month in aims of building a portfolio for publication), different methodologies or practices I might bring into my work (play when my work feels stale or serious, devotion when I want to commit to completing a piece) and writing prompts or exercises similar to ones we explored in class, in aims of expanding my writing into new territory. 

#### Why were the Oupilo writers so interested in the intersection of maths and literature?
The Oupilo writers were fascinated by the intersection of maths and literature because of the possibilities of creative constraints. When mathematical structures or rules are applied to writing, it can produce unexpected results. 

#### How does algorithmic writing make us think differently about authorship?
In my perspective, algorithmic writing is a means of collaboration, but instead of collaborating with a peer you are collaborating with an algorithm or machine, made by humans. The idea of 'remixing' work certainly blurs the lines between plagiarism and inspiration, which to me feels like a natural consequence of the breadth of writing freely available to interact with on the internet. The analogue version of 'remixing' someone else's work might be the cento poem, which is a poem made up of words from other poets. When thinking about algorithmic writing the book Theory of Colours by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe comes to mind, a book entirely composed of other author's words on theme of colour.

#### Lipograms:

##### Prisoner's Constraint:

<em>Original text:</em>
On the first night there is vomit.
Before the vomit she talks at you in the language you have pretended to understand since the morning at the train station where they picked you up and tossed your bags into the back.  
The couch is made of wooden pellets, covered in thin foam. Foam bubbles up and coats your tongue. 
Before talk there is sugo and melone and formaggio sliced thinly and a bottle of homemade red wine. 
You decline. You retract. You are drunk. 
A woman working in the bar corrects your sentences. You repeat after her. Swirl the words around your mouth. Chew on them, swallow, 
but they come rising back up.  
Bile tainted with track changes. 
You sit on the wooden pellet couch that is covered in a red blanket. You try the acupuncture technique to stop nausea that the remedial massage therapist you used to date taught you. You press down on your right wrist with your left thumb.
She walks in mid-vomit and comforts you with words that feel-are familiar. 
Mid shower, the water runs out. You stand naked in front of the tiny sink rinsing shampoo from your dead ends. 
Outside the bathroom window, a soccer ball is tossed between small dirty soles.

### Week 4 Reflection: 

This class has expanded my perspective on what a reader is. If before I thought of a reader as static, I now understand that a reader in E-lit is also an interactor or collaborator, and when having to do actions and make decisions to allow the narrative to unfold, they ‘make the work’. This feels like a profound change in how I view my writing practice and who I create works for. 

For my Folio, I have decided on using my piece called 'The Tank', named after the upside-down water tank my mum lived in for a portion of her childhood after her parents migrated from Calabria, Italy to regional Victoria. I believe using Twine would be the most effective tool to translate this story, so far, because of the illusion of choice a user-reader experiences when interacting with the piece, which mirrors the illusion of choice a migrant experienced in the 60's when moving to Australia, forced to move by poverty and thrust into a different form of poverty in Australia. 

I also like the element of a concealed ending with Twine stories as opposed to traditional writing, where the user-reader is being led down a dark path with no end in sight.

*Archival research into family photographs and artefacts and an interview with my Nonna were conducted before mapping. This gave me provided me with new knowledge on the narrative I am exploring and provided me with an auditory and visual understanding of how I might create the soundscape within the work.*

### Week 6 Reflection: 

See the slide deck on Canvas modules Student Works 2024. These are three successful examples of developed digital works and they are all very different. Critically reflect on these works by asking the same sort of questions as you asked of the case study Ass 1:

**How does it work?**  
<em>House on the Hill</em> is a browser-based interactive fiction work that invites the user/reader to explore a pixelated domestic space using standard keyboard navigation (arrow keys or WASD). The reader interacts with environmental objects and characters, each expanding fragments of a larger narrative. Text appears as though being typed, but the pacing can be controlled manually by the user. This introduces a subtle tension between narrative pacing and player impatience. 

**What does it do?**  
The work constructs a sense of suspense and unease through its audiovisual atmosphere and the fragmented narrative structure. The looping music, combined with pixelated visuals and the soft, muted colour palette, evokes a sense of nostalgia. Interactions (like phone calls and character conversations) offer glimpses into a story of unresolved familial tension. The deliberate ambiguity of the narrative raises questions such as, whose house is this? what happened to cause the protagonist to run away? This compels the user/reader to explore the narrative to it's ending, even though that ending is concealed. 

**How does the reader interact with the piece?**  
<em>House on the Hill</em> asserts a form of narrative co-authorship, where the player’s choices construct their own version of the story. The reader must actively navigate the space and choose which objects or characters to engage with. Crucially, the story does not advance without this interaction, meaning the narrative is entirely contingent on the reader’s movement and decisions. 

**What is conveyed by the digital work?**  
This work is a psychogeographical text, suggested through environmental clues and emotionally charged dialogue. Themes of family dysfunction, loss, and memory are conveyed through both the textual content and the domestic setting. The ambiguity invites multiple interpretation. Paired with the suspension of symbols alluding to something bad happening momentarily, this  strengthens its emotional resonance. 

**How does the digital affordance work with the piece’s themes?**  
Digital affordances—such as non-linear exploration, responsive text, and audio-visual elements —support the central themes of fragmentation and emotional discovery. The game mechanics do not simply house the narrative; they *are* the narrative. Each interaction represents a metaphorical unlocking of memory or meaning. The structure of the work encourages varied pathways through the story, subtly reflecting the subjective and often disjointed nature of memory itself. 

**Does its function deepen the meaning and interpretation of the themes for you as a reader?**  
Yes. The narrative is not fully delivered through text alone; it must be pieced together by the reader, mirroring the emotional labour of complex familial relationships. 

**How does the text change between readings?**  
The work is designed to support variation across readings. While it progresses toward a singular conclusion, the route taken alters the rhythm and emphasis of the experience. Some narrative fragments may be missed entirely depending on the reader’s path, inviting multiple play-throughs of the piece. 

**Movement**  
Movement is essential to the narrative experience. Without reader engagement, the story remains dormant. Movement is not just a visual device—it’s a structural and thematic engine. Kinetic elements—such as blinking cursors, flickering lights, and characters that float or glitch—create a sense of intrigue and immersion. The text is not a thriller story, flat on the page, but an entire world that user/reader's become implicated in when making choices around the narrative direction. 

### Week 7 Reflection: 

#### Folio Ideation: 
![img20231004_21490864](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd3359c-fb87-441a-b155-c26d2f4b83ef)

<em>The journey into Santo Todaro is winding and mountainous, it's physically and emotionally taxing. Along the way, the protagonist encounters several dead ends, literal and metaphorical. The layout of the village reflects this: a chaotic layering of structures, staircases that lead nowhere, and buildings stacked with no obvious logic. It’s as though the architecture itself resists coherence — echoing the protagonist’s internal disorientation.
This section draws on the concept of psychogeography. As the protagonist walks these uneven paths, turning sharp corners and retracing steps, the spatial confusion heightens a sense of displacement. The unfamiliar layout mirrors the protagonist’s fragmented sense of identity, and the inherited memories tied to this place become more potent. 
The photograph shown here mirrors this experience — a narrow laneway hemmed in by mismatched walls, a staircase that feels more like a question than an answer.</em>

#### Folio Troubleshooting:

##### Troubleshooting the Appearance of Parentheses in My Twine Project

I started by trying to display large, bold parentheses ( ) in my Twine project using a CSS class called .big-brackets. Initially, the parentheses didn’t appear, even though I had added the correct HTML structure and applied CSS rules to make them visible.

Step 1: Trying Basic CSS Styling
My first attempt involved styling the parentheses using a simple .big-brackets class. I applied the CabrionLight font, increased the font size to 12rem, and made the text bold. I also ensured the text was centered with text-align: center and set the color to #3C3633. However, the parentheses still didn’t show up, despite the code looking correct.

Step 2: Adjusting the CSS Selector
Next, I considered the possibility that the CSS selector wasn’t targeting the parentheses correctly. I refined the CSS by targeting the <div class="big-brackets"> specifically. I also made sure that the font file for CabrionLight was properly linked in the project, with the correct @font-face rule.
Despite these changes, the parentheses still weren’t visible.

Step 3: Checking HTML Structure and Content
I double-checked the HTML content in my Twine passage, ensuring that the parentheses ( ) were correctly typed and placed inside the <div class="big-brackets"> tag. Everything looked fine at this point.

Step 4: Testing with a Simple Font
To isolate the issue, I tested the font with a system font, Arial, instead of CabrionLight. This helped me confirm that the issue wasn’t related to the font itself but likely to how the CSS was being applied.

Step 5: Adding the !important Flag
I then added !important to my CSS properties to make sure they took precedence. While this didn’t resolve the issue, it did show me that the CSS was being applied.

Step 6: Exploring Developer Tools
I used the Developer Tools in my browser to inspect the rendered HTML and CSS. Through this inspection, I could confirm that the parentheses were not being rendered as expected. After more testing, I realized that the <div class="big-brackets"> wasn't being properly displayed because of some missing or conflicting styles.

Step 7: Refining the CSS to Display Parentheses
Finally, I used a simple CSS rule to directly target the parentheses in the passage and applied the desired styling. I used the following CSS:
css
CopyEdit
.big-brackets {
  font-family: 'CabrionLight', sans-serif !important;
  font-size: 12rem !important;
  font-weight: bold !important;
  text-align: center !important;
  color: #3C3633 !important;
  margin: 5rem 0 !important;
}
With this, the parentheses finally appeared! However, they were too large for my design.

##### Troubleshooting the Audio Not Playing in My Twine Story
I encountered an issue while trying to add background audio to my Twine game. The code I initially used was:
html
CopyEdit
<audio id="background-audio" loop autoplay>
  <source src="audio/Space8-NalaSinephro.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

However, despite this code being correct, the audio did not play as expected, and I got the following error in the browser's developer tools:
pgsql
CopyEdit
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
This suggested that there was a problem with the file path or the file itself.

Step 1: Checking the File Path
I first confirmed that the file path was correct. My audio file, Space8-NalaSinephro.mp3, was placed inside the audio/ folder. However, I still received the error message indicating that the browser couldn’t find the file.

Step 2: Renaming the Audio File
I attempted renaming the file to eliminate any potential issues with spaces or special characters in the name. The file was renamed to Space8-NalaSinephro.mp3, and I made sure to update the path in my Twine code accordingly:
html
CopyEdit
<audio id="background-audio" loop autoplay>
  <source src="audio/Space8-NalaSinephro.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
But the issue persisted, with the same ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND error showing up.

Step 3: Double-Checking the File Location
I also checked the file location using the browser's file path system. When I clicked on the link to the file directly, I saw:
bash
CopyEdit
file:///Users/marleyabbott/Documents/Twine/Scratch/audio/Space8-NalaSinephro.mp3
This path seemed correct on the surface, but the browser still couldn't locate the file when I tried to access it through my Twine story.
Step 4: Testing the Audio File Directly

I opened the audio file in a separate tab by clicking directly on it. It played fine, which confirmed that the audio file itself wasn’t corrupted or problematic. So the issue seemed to be related to the way Twine was handling the file.

Step 5: Moving the File
Since the file was stored locally, I moved the audio file into the same folder as my index.html file, in case the relative path wasn’t being recognized correctly.
I then updated the code to:
html
CopyEdit
<audio id="background-audio" loop autoplay>
  <source src="Space8-NalaSinephro.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
But this didn't fix the issue either. The browser still couldn’t locate the file, and the audio still didn’t play. I'm still working on resolving this issue. 

##### Troubleshooting Fade-out transition
1. Attempt 1: Using transition with (enchant:) and css
The goal was to apply a fade-out using a transition on opacity, but it didn’t trigger the fade effect correctly, and the text disappeared immediately after the 4s wait without fading.
Code:
|fadeOut>[You walk the parameters of the story, graze your hand on the corrugated iron edges.]

(after: 4s)[
  (enchant: ?fadeOut, (css: "opacity: 0; transition: opacity 3s ease;"))
]
(after: 7s)[
  (goto: "Next Passage")
]
Issue:
•	The transition didn’t work as expected because the text wasn’t re-rendered with the new style in time. The opacity change was applied immediately, but it was too abrupt without proper animation timing.
 
2. Attempt 2: Using @keyframes and animation with (enchant:)
The second attempt involved using a @keyframes animation to slowly fade out the text by animating the opacity. However, applying this animation with (enchant:) didn’t work as planned.
Code:
@keyframes fadeOut {
  from { opacity: 1; }
  to { opacity: 0; }
}

.fadeOutSlow {
  animation: fadeOut 3s ease forwards;
}
|fadeOut>[You walk the parameters of the story, graze your hand on the corrugated iron edges.]

(after: 4s)[
  (enchant: ?fadeOut, (css: "animation: fadeOut 3s ease forwards;"))
]

(after: 7s)[
  (replace: ?fadeOut)[]
  (goto: "Next Passage")
]
Issue:
•	The (enchant:) approach didn’t trigger the animation effectively because it wasn’t causing a proper reflow of the element’s styles.
•	The fadeOutSlow class applied via CSS was correct, but we didn’t get the intended animation.
 
3. Attempt 3: Using transition-time and chaining changers
The aim here was to use Harlowe’s built-in transition-time functionality to slow down the dissolve effect. But this led to errors indicating that changers like transition-time: need to be combined with a +.
Code:
|fadeOut>[You walk the parameters of the story, graze your hand on the corrugated iron edges.]

(after: 4s)[
  (transition: "dissolve") 
  (replace: ?fadeOut)[ ]
  (goto: "Next Passage")
]
Issue:
•	The transition was not applied as expected, and the error regarding combining changers (transition-time) appeared.
•	The text disappeared instantly instead of fading out over time.
 
None of these approaches yielded the desired fade-out effect over time due to issues with re-rendering elements and Harlowe's handling of transitions and animations.
 
Working Solution
As a final working solution, I applied CSS animations with @keyframes, and used a different approach to handle the fade and passage transition:
@keyframes fadeOut {
  from { opacity: 1; }
  to { opacity: 0; }
}

.fadeOutSlow {
  animation: fadeOut 3s ease forwards;
}
|fadeOut>[<span class="fade-target">You walk the parameters of the story, graze your hand on the corrugated iron edges.</span>]

(after: 4s)[
  (enchant: ?fadeOut, (css: "animation: fadeOut 3s ease forwards;"))
]

(after: 7s)[
  (replace: ?fadeOut)[]
  (goto: "Next Passage")
]
