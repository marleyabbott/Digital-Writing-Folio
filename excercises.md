## Exercises
### Week 1 Reflection: 
<p>
On the tram to uni this morning, I wrote this down in my notebook:
'These systems we rely on to run our lives (like Google), are much more fragile than they seem. We believe, because our whole lives are stored and tracked and planned with the systems, that they are permanent, structurally sound, safe. But then someone like Elon Musk can buy Google, ruin it and we will move on to something else. The things that we thought were so permanent and important won't be anymore'.

<em> A repository is like a [container]. A place to store all of the information. All of the language. 
  You push, I pull.
On the phone you said that you still loved me. 
I didn't know if it was the right thing to do, and I don't know the meaning behind this language of symbols, 
  but I told you that I loved you too. </em>
  
I'm not sure what I was expecting today, but the class was a lot more code-orientated than writing-orientated, and I'm wondering when we will discuss the possibilities of expanding our practice in the digital format. I'm feeling intrigued but a little intimidated. My brain doesn't feel wired to do coding. I always struggled with STEM subjects in school, got frustrated, then bored. There's something too black and white about mathematics and science and technology. There is only one right answer (most of the time), and it bores me. I'd be much more interested if I could break the code somehow, break through to something new, if I didn't have to get it right to make it work for the reader. Maybe I don't have to... 

There is something about 'E-lit' that pinches my intestine. I am currently translating words written into my notebook and pasting it into this code. I want to move away from online and move into the real world. Where the words are spoken out loud. The sound travels... echos, it rustles a tree, a tangible thing, a statement that we were here. People listen to a story spoken and something shifts in them. 

But then I think about all of the stories I've read online. How they've shifted something in me. How that is real, that feeling is tangible, and in some ways permanent, accessible, even if the internet is not. 

<em> Are we really producing this amount of carbon emissions for something that can all just disappear? 
CO2 isn't seen, but it's effects are felt. 
E-lit is like a gas, it slips through your fingers but does something permanent to your hands on the way through.</em>

Maybe not knowing how to do this, not knowing how to control the format and language like I normally can will show me something about my writing that I couldn't see before. I feel like I'm feeling my way around in the dark until I commit the changes. And it usually looks different to what I was expecting, but sometimes it looks better.

### Week 2 Reflection: 
<p>
Frustrated at the coding practice, but starting to internally map what a Folio might look like. When choosing photos for our glitch coding playground, my computer brought up images of my familie's village, Santo Todaro in Calabria. It felt like a sign. I opened an old writing project that I never finished about Italy and my heritage. The piece attempted to get near the elusive experience of visiting the village for the first time and not knowing how to speak the language. Being by myself in that small mountainous street. Fumbling my way through conversations, everything felt like a bad translation.

I think that's where I want to go with my folio, that frustration and grief at nearly, but not quite understanding something that I should. Like coding because I grew up in a digital era, or my Italian dialect, because it is who I am. I should know these things. I don't. 

In Glitch when we input the new code for the 'retry' computer error container, all of these memories of bad translations came to me. Those sexual inuendos I didn't mean to make in front of my zio e zia, when I vomited on my first night and tried to explain that I was sick (male) but instead received a giant platter of fruit in return (apple- mela). 

The homecoming, that exhausting day of driving around and around the mountain, nearing the village and then not quite reaching it, the tears that could not be contained when I hugged my relatives who I had never met. Still the thing that stays with me most about that trip to Calabria was the wild boar that groaned a goodbye to me as we drove through the sunset, back to the sea. 

How to make something so analogue, like that deserted little village, make sense in a digital format? My only idea so far is to use 'the tank' (the water tank my mum lived in for a portion of her childhood), as the 'container' for something. Like the containers on glitch that we are coding.

I can see a connection forming between the language of coding and the calabrese dialect. The different knowledges emerging and also the not knowing.
</p>

### Week 3 Reflection: 

I sat down at a cafe on Friday morning and edited my Glitch coding playground. To my surprise, for the first time in this class, I enjoyed the process of coding. Since I have been doing freecodecamp week by week, I can see my understanding of the language and structure of coding expand. With help from GPT, I was able to make some significant changes to the playground, removing containers that didn't make sense to my theme. 

#### What is an algorithm? What is a constraint?
An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules designed to perform a task or solve a problem. It can be as simple as a recipe for baking a cake or as complex as the code behind search engines and artificial intelligence. A constraint is a limitation or condition that must be followed when solving a problem or designing a system. Constraints exist in many areas, including coding, writing, design, and real-world problem-solving.
(from chatGPT) 

#### Can you think of ways you might already be using these in your writing? (e.g., tools, techniques or processes that constrain and sytematise the way you write)?
I use an algorithm to organise my writing life on a program called Notion. My notion stores my yearly writing projects where I can drag and drop them into Rick Rubin's craft stages: seed, experimentation, craft, workshop (my addition), completion and publication. In my Notion software I also keep my artist statement, a monthly lexicon of new words, a calendar with my publication dates and submission close dates, and a 'honey pot' of writing prompts and ideas that I can turn to when in need of inspiration. 

I use constraints in various ways in my practice, from setting boundaries with writing time (One 4 hour+ weekly writing session where my phone stays off and I work on a personal writing project), goals around production of work (last year I completed one writing project a month in aims of building a portfolio for publication), different methodologies or practices I might bring into my work (play when my work feels stale or serious, devotion when I want to commit to completing a piece) and writing prompts or exercises similar to ones we explored in class, in aims of expanding my writing into new territory. 

#### Why were the Oupilo writers so interested in the intersection of maths and literature?
The Oupilo writers were fascinated by the intersection of maths and literature because of the possibilities of creative constraints. When mathematical structures or rules are applied to writing, it can produce unexpected results. 

#### How does algorithmic writing make us think differently about authorship?
In my perspective, algorithmic writing is a means of collaboration, but instead of collaborating with a peer you are collaborating with an algorithm or machine, made by humans. The idea of 'remixing' work certainly blurs the lines between plagiarism and inspiration, which to me feels like a natural consequence of the breadth of writing freely available to interact with on the internet. The analogue version of 'remixing' someone else's work might be the cento poem, which is a poem made up of words from other poets. When thinking about algorithmic writing the book Theory of Colours by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe comes to mind, a book entirely composed of other author's words on theme of colour.

##### Prisoner's Constraint:

<em>Original text:</em>
On the first night there is vomit.
Before the vomit she talks at you in the language you have pretended to understand since the morning at the train station where they picked you up and tossed your bags into the back.  
The couch is made of wooden pellets, covered in thin foam. Foam bubbles up and coats your tongue. 
Before talk there is sugo and melone and formaggio sliced thinly and a bottle of homemade red wine. 
You decline. You retract. You are drunk. 
A woman working in the bar corrects your sentences. You repeat after her. Swirl the words around your mouth. Chew on them, swallow, 
but they come rising back up.  
Bile tainted with track changes. 
You sit on the wooden pellet couch that is covered in a red blanket. You try the acupuncture technique to stop nausea that the remedial massage therapist you used to date taught you. You press down on your right wrist with your left thumb.
She walks in mid-vomit and comforts you with words that feel-are familiar. 
Mid shower, the water runs out. You stand naked in front of the tiny sink rinsing shampoo from your dead ends. 
Outside the bathroom window, a soccer ball is tossed between small dirty soles.

### Week 4 Reflection: 

This class has expanded my perspective on what a reader is. If before I thought of a reader as static, I now understand that a reader in E-lit is also an interactor or collaborator, and when having to do actions and make decisions to allow the narrative to unfold, they ‘make the work’. This feels like a profound change in how I view my writing practice and who I create works for. 

For my Folio, I have decided on using my piece called 'The Tank', named after the upside-down water tank my mum lived in for a portion of her childhood after her parents migrated from Calabria, Italy to regional Victoria. I believe using Twine would be the most effective tool to translate this story, so far, because of the illusion of choice a user-reader experiences when interacting with the piece, which mirrors the illusion of choice a migrant experienced in the 60's when moving to Australia, forced to move by poverty and thrust into a different form of poverty in Australia. 

I also like the element of a concealed ending with Twine stories as opposed to traditional writing, where the user-reader is being led down a dark path with no end in sight.

*Archival research into family photographs and artefacts and an interview with my Nonna were conducted before mapping. This gave me provided me with new knowledge on the narrative I am exploring and provided me with an auditory and visual understanding of how I might create the soundscape within the work.*

### Week 6 Reflection: 

See the slide deck on Canvas modules Student Works 2024. These are three successful examples of developed digital works and they are all very different. Critically reflect on these works by asking the same sort of questions as you asked of the case study Ass 1:

**How does it work?**  
<em>House on the Hill</em> is a browser-based interactive fiction work that invites the user/reader to explore a pixelated domestic space using standard keyboard navigation (arrow keys or WASD). The reader interacts with environmental objects and characters, each expanding fragments of a larger narrative. Text appears as though being typed, but the pacing can be controlled manually by the user. This introduces a subtle tension between narrative pacing and player impatience. 

**What does it do?**  
The work constructs a sense of suspense and unease through its audiovisual atmosphere and the fragmented narrative structure. The looping music, combined with pixelated visuals and the soft, muted colour palette, evokes a sense of nostalgia. Interactions (like phone calls and character conversations) offer glimpses into a story of unresolved familial tension. The deliberate ambiguity of the narrative raises questions such as, whose house is this? what happened to cause the protagonist to run away? This compels the user/reader to explore the narrative to it's ending, even though that ending is concealed. 

**How does the reader interact with the piece?**  
<em>House on the Hill</em> asserts a form of narrative co-authorship, where the player’s choices construct their own version of the story. The reader must actively navigate the space and choose which objects or characters to engage with. Crucially, the story does not advance without this interaction, meaning the narrative is entirely contingent on the reader’s movement and decisions. 

**What is conveyed by the digital work?**  
This work is a psychogeographical text, suggested through environmental clues and emotionally charged dialogue. Themes of family dysfunction, loss, and memory are conveyed through both the textual content and the domestic setting. The ambiguity invites multiple interpretation. Paired with the suspension of symbols alluding to something bad happening momentarily, this  strengthens its emotional resonance. 

**How does the digital affordance work with the piece’s themes?**  
Digital affordances—such as non-linear exploration, responsive text, and audio-visual elements —support the central themes of fragmentation and emotional discovery. The game mechanics do not simply house the narrative; they *are* the narrative. Each interaction represents a metaphorical unlocking of memory or meaning. The structure of the work encourages varied pathways through the story, subtly reflecting the subjective and often disjointed nature of memory itself. 

**Does its function deepen the meaning and interpretation of the themes for you as a reader?**  
Yes. The narrative is not fully delivered through text alone; it must be pieced together by the reader, mirroring the emotional labour of complex familial relationships. 

**How does the text change between readings?**  
The work is designed to support variation across readings. While it progresses toward a singular conclusion, the route taken alters the rhythm and emphasis of the experience. Some narrative fragments may be missed entirely depending on the reader’s path, inviting multiple play-throughs of the piece. 

**Movement**  
Movement is essential to the narrative experience. Without reader engagement, the story remains dormant. Movement is not just a visual device—it’s a structural and thematic engine. Kinetic elements—such as blinking cursors, flickering lights, and characters that float or glitch—create a sense of intrigue and immersion. The text is not a thriller story, flat on the page, but an entire world that user/reader's become implicated in when making choices around the narrative direction. 

### Week 7 Reflection: 

#### Folio Ideation: 
![img20231004_21490864](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd3359c-fb87-441a-b155-c26d2f4b83ef)

<em>The journey into Santo Todaro is winding and mountainous, it's physically and emotionally taxing. Along the way, the protagonist encounters several dead ends, literal and metaphorical. The layout of the village reflects this: a chaotic layering of structures, staircases that lead nowhere, and buildings stacked with no obvious logic. It’s as though the architecture itself resists coherence — echoing the protagonist’s internal disorientation.
This section draws on the concept of psychogeography. As the protagonist walks these uneven paths, turning sharp corners and retracing steps, the spatial confusion heightens a sense of displacement. The unfamiliar layout mirrors the protagonist’s fragmented sense of identity, and the inherited memories tied to this place become more potent. 
The photograph shown here mirrors this experience — a narrow laneway hemmed in by mismatched walls, a staircase that feels more like a question than an answer.</em>

### Week 8 Reflection: 

#### Reflection on Feedback and Peer Presentations Required activity for final folio (can be completed anytime this week)
*What has been introduced? Summarise your proposed piece*

##### What are the themes and ideas is your piece is exploring?:
The themes I will be exploring:
-       Translation: Dialect vs Italian vs English
-       Psycho-geography
-       Sacrifice
-       Generational continuity: the story continuing inside of us
-       Poverty and trauma due to immigration
-       Object symbolism

##### What literary genre or style are you drawing on? Is it narrative driven or more poetic and associative? Or essayistic?
'The Tank' is a creative non-fiction work that uses poetic associations that leans into misunderstanding to illustrate an experience of being between two languages and two homes. It works with two timelines: the inherited (my mother's childhood story) and the present (my own experience of visiting the village alone. 

A layered soundscape deepens the disorientation—English text is interrupted by recordings in Calabrese, including voices of my nonna, nonno, and mother. The overlap fragments the reading experience, mirroring the protagonist’s struggle to grasp meaning in a language she only half-knows.

##### What is the story? Or, what do you want to express/communicate through this piece?
The title of the work is called, ‘The Tank’. The Tank is a digital work made using twine that traces the protagonist’s journey through their family’s village, Santo Todaro in Southern Italy. 

Written in second person, the protagonist (you) traces a family story passed down through generations. The piece moves between present-day experiences of visiting the village for the first time and inherited memories and stories, using family photographs, a soundscape and interactive elements. 

My aim with ‘The Tank’ is to explore what it means to return to a place you've never physically been but have experienced through inheritance. The project invites the user/reader to experience disorientation, psycho-geographical memory, and the limitations, and power, of translation. 

In writing this piece, I was very inspired by this KYD piece, ‘The Still’ by Scott McCulloch: https://www.killyourdarlings.com.au/article/the-still/

##### What do you wish the reader to understand or feel?
I want the reader to be caught between two worlds and feel on the brink of understanding, but ultimately feel lost. I want the reader to navigate the journey through psycho-geography (places holding deep resonance) and for the two timelines and countries to intersect by the ending of the playthrough. 

##### What needs to be developed?
As the written portion of the work is mostly developed, the soundscape is the main element of the work that needs to be worked on I also need to work on coding the visual elements so that the transition of my vision from clean editorial to messy kitchen table can be executed. 

##### What drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?
A desire to understand the untranslatable elements as well as a desire to connect the two timelines (the tank and the village) will drive the reader's momentum. The physical journey leading into and out of the village will also be a more tangible way that the reader navigates the story. This is where the inherited story and present-day timeline come together, while the visual and auditory elements become more layered and chaotic. The story resists coherence because of the nature of immigration and displacement: things get lost in translation, things get left behind and new paths get forged while tendrils to the past cannot be cut. 

##### How does the literary and the digital drive the momentum together with the piece’s thematic?

The soundscape draws on archival recordings of my nonna, nonno, and mum speaking Italian, layered over the English narration to heighten the sense of linguistic dissonance. Sound effects will be used, such as echo’s and water droplets to mimick being inside the tank.

Archival photographs of my family and the village will appear alongside the text, grounding the piece in a personal and historical visual language. Initially, the work has a clean, editorial aesthetic—but as the narrative unfolds, this minimalist style begins to fracture. The layout becomes increasingly chaotic and disorienting, visually mirroring the narrator’s emotional fragmentation. Fade outs, flashing text and text being revealed will be used to emphasize the writing. The work will completely transform into something that emulates a kitchen table in a poor Italian household.

*Second person voice*
- Proximity vs. distance
- Reader placed inside the narrator’s body
- Reflects narrator’s dissociation—can’t claim I
- Digital writing: game/story boundary blurs
- Second person boosts interactivity & emotional stakes
- Voice = not style, but structural necessity

While the narrative branch on Twine is somewhat linear, the user/reader will still make some choices about how the narrative progresses  and they will be able to interact with the text using functions such as clicking to reveal text underneath images.

*Scope and Scale*

##### How many words will it be?
- The current draft is roughly 1,500 words
  
##### How many screens?
- 20-30 screens 

##### What do you need to do on a week-by-week basis (is this realistic?)
- Week 8: Intro finalised
- Week 9: Chapter 1 and 2 finalised
- Week 10: Chapter 3 and 4 finalised
- Week 11: Chapter 5 and 6 finalised
- Week 12: Ending finalised and troubleshooting

##### What is the tech that might get you stuck? what is the workaround/Plan B?
- Adding images, image maps and image backgrounds (I feel confident that with the help of resources, classmates and chatGPT that I will be able to execute the images, however the CSS for formatting images in the way I envision will be time consuming). 
- Adding audio for the soundscape, and layering the audio so the sounds begin to collate and become more chaotic (If the audio can't be executed because of Harlowe, I am confident the themes of the piece will carry the rest of the work). 
- Visual effects such as fade outs, flickering, texting falling/collapsing (I am confident that these will work as I have seen them work successfully in the works of students from last year, but it is important to not that it can be time consuming to add these elements).
