# Digital Writing
## Exercises
### Week 1 Reflection: 
<p>
On the tram to uni this morning, I wrote this down in my notebook:
'These systems we rely on to run our lives (like Google), are much more fragile than they seem. We believe, because our whole lives are stored and tracked and planned with the systems, that they are permanent, structurally sound, safe. But then someone like Elon Musk can buy Google, ruin it and we will move on to something else. The things that we thought were so permanent and important won't be anymore'.

<em> A repository is like a [container]. A place to store all of the information. All of the language. 
  You push, I pull.
On the phone you said that you still loved me. 
I didn't know if it was the right thing to do, and I don't know the meaning behind this language of symbols, 
  but I told you that I loved you too. </em>
  
I'm not sure what I was expecting today, but the class was a lot more code-orientated than writing-orientated, and I'm wondering when we will discuss the possibilities of expanding our practice in the digital format. I'm feeling intrigued but a little intimidated. My brain doesn't feel wired to do coding. I always struggled with STEM subjects in school, got frustrated, then bored. There's something too black and white about mathematics and science and technology. There is only one right answer (most of the time), and it bores me. I'd be much more interested if I could break the code somehow, break through to something new, if I didn't have to get it right to make it work for the reader. Maybe I don't have to... 

There is something about 'E-lit' that pinches my intestine. I am currently translating words written into my notebook and pasting it into this code. I want to move away from online and move into the real world. Where the words are spoken out loud. The sound travels... echos, it rustles a tree, a tangible thing, a statement that we were here. People listen to a story spoken and something shifts in them. 

But then I think about all of the stories I've read online. How they've shifted something in me. How that is real, that feeling is tangible, and in some ways permanent, accessible, even if the internet is not. 

<em> Are we really producing this amount of carbon emissions for something that can all just disappear? 
CO2 isn't seen, but it's effects are felt. 
E-lit is like a gas, it slips through your fingers but does something permanent to your hands on the way through.</em>

Maybe not knowing how to do this, not knowing how to control the format and language like I normally can will show me something about my writing that I couldn't see before. I feel like I'm feeling my way around in the dark until I commit the changes. And it usually looks different to what I was expecting, but sometimes it looks better.

### Week 2 Reflection: 
</p>
Frustrated at the coding practice, but starting to internally map what a Folio might look like. When choosing photos for our glitch coding playground, my computer brought up images of my familie's village, Santo Todaro in Calabria. It felt like a sign. I opened an old writing project that I never finished about Italy and my heritage. The piece attempted to get near the elusive experience of visiting the village for the first time and not knowing how to speak the language. Being by myself in that small mountainous street. Fumbling my way through conversations, everything felt like a bad translation.

I think that's where I want to go with my folio, that frustration and grief at nearly, but not quite understanding something that I should. Like coding because I grew up in a digital era, or my Italian dialect, because it is who I am. I should know these things. I don't. 

In Glitch when we input the new code for the 'retry' computer error container, all of these memories of bad translations came to me. Those sexual inuendos I didn't mean to make in front of my zio e zia, when I vomited on my first night and tried to explain that I was sick (male) but instead received a giant platter of fruit in return (apple- mela). 

The homecoming, that exhausting day of driving around and around the mountain, nearing the village and then not quite reaching it, the tears that could not be contained when I hugged my relatives who I had never met. Still the thing that stays with me most about that trip to Calabria was the wild boar that groaned a goodbye to me as we drove through the sunset, back to the sea. 

How to make something so analogue, like that deserted little village, make sense in a digital format? My only idea so far is to use 'the tank' (the water tank my mum lived in for a portion of her childhood), as the 'container' for something. Like the containers on glitch that we are coding.

I can see a connection forming between the language of coding and the calabrese dialect. The different knowledges emerging and also the not knowing.
