## Readings

### Week 1 Reflection: 

Required Writing Task: Electronic Literature Collection Analysis

Volume 1: Twelve Blue by Michael Joyce
Michael Joyce's ‘Twelve Blue’ (1996) uses HTML frames and clickable hyperlinks to weave together twelve stories around the colour blue. What makes it digital literature is the non-linear reading experience, where readers click through coloured thread navigation bars and embedded links to jump between narrative fragments. The hyperlink structure functions similarly to contemporary interactive fiction platforms. 

While the writing itself is poetic and evocative, the navigation system can be disorienting, making it difficult to track character connections across storylines. The work demonstrates innovative use of digital technology for 1996, though the interface feels dated by current standards.

Volume 2: Sound Poems by Jörg Piringer
Jörg Piringer's "Sound Poems" (2006) turns letters into digital creatures that bounce around the screen, eating each other and making sounds based on algorithms. It's digital literature because the letters literally behave like code, following programmed rules when they crash into each other or hit the screen edges. The work takes concrete poetry and makes it move and make noise, which feels genuinely new and engaging to watch. However, there's not much to "read" in a traditional sense - it's more like watching a screensaver with linguistic elements, and the novelty wears off after a few minutes.

Volume 3: My Hands/Wishful Thinking by Mendi & Keith Obadike
This piece by Mendi and Keith Obadike (2008) uses popup windows and a repeating image of a hand holding a wallet to memorialize Amadou Diallo, who was killed by police in 1999. It uses the early web's popup aesthetic and automated sound to create an online memorial space. The political message is powerful and the concept of writing thoughts for each bullet fired is incredibly profound. It turns the web into a space for activism and mourning, which feels important. However, the Flash-based technology means it is not very accessible without special preservation software.

Volume 4: c-ya-laterrrr by Dan Hett
This Twine game by Dan Hett (2017) explores the author's experience during the Manchester Arena bombing on May 22, 2017, when his brother was killed. What makes it digital writing is how the branching narrative structure mirrors trauma processing: the "would have/could have/should have" thoughts that cycle through your mind after a tragedy. The stripped-back design (black text on white background) deliberately avoids flashy digital effects to focus entirely on the language. The work demonstrates that effective electronic literature doesn't need complex algorithms or visual tricks—sometimes the power comes from using the medium thoughtfully. The branching paths let you experience the uncertainty and difficult choices that follow trauma, making it more immersive than traditional prose could be. The minimalist design feels respectful and appropriate for the heavy subject matter. However, there's something unsettling about "playing" through someone's real grief, even though that discomfort might be part of the point.

### Week 3 Reflection: 

#### The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)

The kinetic poem <em>Taroko Gorge</em> is endlessly generated, creating an endless experience. While I didn't find this piece particularly engaging, the concept of remixing a poem infinitely through code interests me. The text operates in a non-static way, much like a cento poem, where meaning is continuously reshaped. The work also speaks to questions of authorship and control, as the reader has no direct interaction but experiences an ever-changing flow of words dictated by the platform. 
   
#### The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)

In the <em>The Gathering Cloud</em>, I really enjoyed the metaphor of the cloud was used and how the form and content interact– a digital poem critiquing the environmental impact of digital technologies. The piece has an analogue quality, with its hand-drawn illustrations and subtle animations, which reminds me of early internet aesthetics. I'm beginning to understand how e-lit prioritizes interaction and engagement over passive reading, implicating the user in the construction of meaning. Digital writing isn't just about reading—it's about exploring, playing, and experiencing the text as dynamic. This work creates a sense of overwhelm, layering text and visual elements in a way that feels immersive rather than purely linear. I'm thinking about how I can incorporate this technique in my final project. 

#### The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)

<em>First Draft of the Revolution</em> by Emily Short is a very effective example of interactive fiction. This piece felt strange to me, and I'm almost hesitant to call it a "text" because of its hybridity– the interactive and 'gamefied' elements. Unlike print fiction, where letters are static, this work asks the reader to actively revise them, altering how the story develops. While I didn't connect with this piece as much because of its fictionalized nature (a genre I don’t write in), I appreciate how it plays with the mechanics of revision and rewriting as part of its storytelling process. The mythical aspects were intriguing, and I liked how just clicking a few buttons could shift the narrative so significantly. The affordances of digital media make this possible in a way that traditional literature cannot. 

#### The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

<em>Shade</em> by Andrew Plotkin was the most intriguing work for me, although I found myself frustrated when I couldn't figure out how to get the character to drink water! After reading "Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin’s Shade" by Jeremy Douglass, I better understand how the narrative unfolds, though I doubt I would have reached the ending on my own. The illusion of reality dissolving is both brutal and beautiful, forcing the reader to reconstruct their understanding of the narrative space. The lack of visuals makes the reader an active participant in world-building, which made me realise that e-lit can operate on an entirely different sensory level than print. The second-person perspective intensifies this effect, further implicating the reader in the unfolding story. This is what makes e-lit so distinct from traditional fiction: it demands more from the reader, requiring participation and interaction rather than just consumption.

### Week 5 Reflection:

#### No senses of an ending : hypertext aesthetics ; chapter 4, pp. 78-96.

Espen Aarseth's concept of ergodics really helps shift how I think about reading and writing, especially in a digital context. Instead of seeing hypertext as just a new way to tell a story, Aarseth (1997) reframes it as something other than narrative altogether. It's not just about choosing your own adventure; it's about how much effort it takes to move through the text, and how that movement is the experience. 

This is relevant to my creative practice where I'm less interested in fixed forms and more drawn to work that invites exploration, play, and disorientation.

Aarseth's (1997) analysis of Afternoon shows how a reader doesn't just follow a story, they perform it, get stuck in it, even feel frustrated by it. That emotional and cognitive engagement becomes part of the meaning. In this way, narrative doesn't have to be the default, the experience of reading, just like the experience of listening to music or another art form, can create meaning of the work. A work can feel like it's telling a story even if it never fully reveals one, and perhaps that's closer to how memory, emotion, or identity actually function: fragmented, nonlinear, full of dead ends and epiphanies.

This directly informs the design of my folio project. Instead of delivering a linear story about my family and the water tank they once lived in, I want readers to walk the parameters of the story, figuratively and digitally. Through interactions, a confusing and overwhelming but dream-like soundscape, they might experience the work rather than understand or interpret it, much like the way stories are passed down in real life: interrupted, re-told, emotionally charged, and sometimes incomplete.

What I find most useful is how Aarseth (1997) offers language to move beyond traditional binaries: author/reader, fiction/fact, literature/game. Afternoon isn't a novel in the classic sense, but it's not not literature either. It exists in a hybrid space. What if a poem could also be a map? What if a memoir could glitch? What if a reader becomes a navigator rather than an audience?
My project isn't a memoir in the classic sense, but it is absolutely autobiographical and derived from embodiment and place. It's a poetic machine, a family archive glitched by geography, grief, and the unreliability of memory. Thinking through ergodics helps me reframe creative practice as less about expressing a fixed meaning, and more about constructing conditions for experience.

### Week 7 Reflection: 

Reading Response: Poetic Playlands: Poetry, Interface, and Video Game Engines. 

Jason Nelson's argument about video games making poetry accessible is compelling. His digital poetry games attract millions of readers while traditional poetry books might sell only a thousand copies, demonstrating how familiar gaming interfaces can introduce audiences to experimental art they would typically avoid. The platform game mechanics work effectively because users already understand basic navigation controls.

What stands out is the polarised reception of Nelson's work, ranging from death threats to marriage proposals, suggesting that his poetry games provoke strong emotional responses (Nelson 2021, p. 343). When Nelson deliberately created work designed to be unconventional purely for attention, it failed to achieve similar engagement. This indicates that authenticity cannot be artificially manufactured, even within digital artistic contexts.

Nelson's concept that games possess their own 'grammar' provides useful insight into digital literacy (Nelson 2021, p. 337). Players already know how to interpret game elements and respond to visual cues, making the transition to poetic gaming interfaces more natural. However, this raises important questions about whether gamifying poetry fundamentally changes what poetry actually is. Does making it more interactive and accessible dilute its essence, or does it create new expressive possibilities? Nelson argues for the latter, and his commercial success suggests that expanding poetry's reach doesn't necessarily compromise its core qualities.
