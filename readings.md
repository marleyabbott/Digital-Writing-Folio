# Digital Writing
## Readings

### Week 1 Reflection: 

#### The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)

I didn't find this piece particularly engaging, although the idea of 'remixing' a poem endlessly using coding interests me for it's possibilities of infinite meaning-making, similar to a cento poem. 
   
#### The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)

I really enjoyed the metaphor of the cloud used in this piece, and how the form and content interacted (a digital poem about the environmental impact of digitisation). There was an 'analogue' aspect of this piece that I would like to emulate. The drawings, strange little animals that appear on the screen and the slight lag when clicking on a new chapter feel very early internet– unrefined and imperfect. I'm beginning to understand the interactability of E-literature that sets it apart from traditional forms. The reader is implicated in the making of the text by the actions they take on screen and the variety of ways that they may interact with the text. You do not create digital writing to be read, but to be explored, played with and engaged with in a more active way than one might with a book. Similarly to screen-writing (although technically very different), digital writing is a very visually reliant form, which excites me a lot. In this poem there is also a sense of overwhelm that I'm seeking to emulate. I'm thinking of the ways that I could bring many different elements in not to be read individually, but for their collective effect. 

#### The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)

This was a strange text that I almost hesitate to call a text because of how playful I felt when reading it. This didn't appeal to me as much as the other readings simply because it was heavily character-driven and fictionalised (a genre I do not write in). I did enjoy engaging in the mythical aspect of it and being able to change the course of the narrative so much just by clicking a few buttons. 

#### The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

This work intrigued me most, although I was frustrated at myself because I could not figure out how to get him to drink water! Now that I have read 'Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin’s Shade' by Jeremy Douglass, I understand the unfolding of the narrative (although I am quite sure I would never have been able to get to the ending myself). The illusion and dissolving of the reality we are made to believe in from the beginning of the work is both brutal and beautiful. The simplicity of the form (no visuals, only text), implicates the reader into the narrative by forcing us to use our imaginations. I had a distinct picture of what the apartment looked like in mind, and that world I had created naturally expanded as I (the player? the character?) moved into different spaces. The second-person voice is also distinct from most traditional fiction writing, again implicating the reader into a 'making' of the work, where their decisions and active engagement are needed to further a narrative.

Beyond Taxonomy: Digital Poetics and the Problem of Reading

#### 'There is nothing to click on, no decision to be made—other than what text to read. The user is engaged at the level of consumption rather
than participation'.
