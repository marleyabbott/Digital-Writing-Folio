## Readings

### Week 1 Reflection: 

#### The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)

The kinetic poem <em>Taroko Gorge</em> is endlessly generated, creating an endless experience. While I didn't find this piece particularly engaging, the concept of remixing a poem infinitely through code interests me. The text operates in a non-static way, much like a cento poem, where meaning is continuously reshaped. The work also speaks to questions of authorship and control, as the reader has no direct interaction but experiences an ever-changing flow of words dictated by the platform. 
   
#### The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)

In the <em>The Gathering Cloud</em>, I really enjoyed the metaphor of the cloud was used and how the form and content interact– a digital poem critiquing the environmental impact of digital technologies. The piece has an analogue quality, with its hand-drawn illustrations and subtle animations, which reminds me of early internet aesthetics. I'm beginning to understand how e-lit prioritizes interaction and engagement over passive reading, implicating the user in the construction of meaning. Digital writing isn't just about reading—it's about exploring, playing, and experiencing the text as dynamic. This work creates a sense of overwhelm, layering text and visual elements in a way that feels immersive rather than purely linear. I'm thinking about how I can incorporate this technique in my final project. 

#### The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)

<em>First Draft of the Revolution</em> by Emily Short is a very effective example of interactive fiction. This piece felt strange to me, and I'm almost hesitant to call it a "text" because of its hybridity– the interactive and 'gamefied' elements. Unlike print fiction, where letters are static, this work asks the reader to actively revise them, altering how the story develops. While I didn't connect with this piece as much because of its fictionalized nature (a genre I don’t write in), I appreciate how it plays with the mechanics of revision and rewriting as part of its storytelling process. The mythical aspects were intriguing, and I liked how just clicking a few buttons could shift the narrative so significantly. The affordances of digital media make this possible in a way that traditional literature cannot. 

#### The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

<em>Shade</em> by Andrew Plotkin was the most intriguing work for me, although I found myself frustrated when I couldn't figure out how to get the character to drink water! After reading "Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin’s Shade" by Jeremy Douglass, I better understand how the narrative unfolds, though I doubt I would have reached the ending on my own. The illusion of reality dissolving is both brutal and beautiful, forcing the reader to reconstruct their understanding of the narrative space. The lack of visuals makes the reader an active participant in world-building, which made me realise that e-lit can operate on an entirely different sensory level than print. The second-person perspective intensifies this effect, further implicating the reader in the unfolding story. This is what makes e-lit so distinct from traditional fiction: it demands more from the reader, requiring participation and interaction rather than just consumption.

### Week 5 Reflection:

#### No senses of an ending : hypertext aesthetics ; chapter 4, pp. 78-96.

Espen Aarseth’s concept of ergodics really helps shift how I think about reading and writing—especially in a digital context. Instead of seeing hypertext as just a new way to tell a story, Aarseth reframes it as something other than narrative altogether. It’s not just about choosing your own adventure; it’s about how much effort it takes to move through the text, and how that movement is the experience. This is relevant to my creative practice where I’m less interested in fixed forms and more drawn to work that invites exploration, play, and disorientation. 

Aarseth’s analysis of Afternoon shows how a reader doesn’t just follow a story, they perform it, get stuck in it, even feel frustrated by it. That emotional and cognitive engagement becomes part of the meaning. In this way, narrative doesn’t have to be the default, the experience of reading, just like the experience of listening to music or another art form, can create meaning of the work. A work can feel like it’s telling a story even if it never fully reveals one, and perhaps that’s closer to how memory, emotion, or identity actually function: fragmented, nonlinear, full of dead ends and epiphanies.

This directly informs the design of my folio project. Instead of delivering a linear story about my family and the water tank they once lived in, I want readers to walk the parameters of the story—figuratively and digitally. Through interactions, a confusing and overwhelming but dream-like soundscape, they might experience the work rather than understand or interpret it, much like the way stories are passed down in real life: interrupted, re-told, emotionally charged, and sometimes incomplete. 

What I find most useful is how Aarseth offers language to move beyond traditional binaries: author/reader, fiction/fact, literature/game. Afternoon isn't a novel in the classic sense, but it’s not not literature either. It exists in a hybrid space. What if a poem could also be a map? What if a memoir could glitch? What if a reader becomes a navigator rather than an audience?

My project isn’t a memoir in the classic sense, but it is absolutely autobiographical and derived from embodiment and place. It’s a poetic machine, a family archive glitched by geography, grief, and the unreliability of memory. Thinking through ergodics helps me reframe creative practice as less about expressing a fixed meaning, and more about constructing conditions for experience.
