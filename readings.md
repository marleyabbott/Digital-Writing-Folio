## Readings

### Week 1 Reflection: 

#### The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)

The kinetic poem <em>Taroko Gorge</em> is endlessly generated, creating an endless experience. While I didn't find this piece particularly engaging, the concept of remixing a poem infinitely through code interests me. The text operates in a non-static way, much like a cento poem, where meaning is continuously reshaped. The work also speaks to questions of authorship and control, as the reader has no direct interaction but experiences an ever-changing flow of words dictated by the platform. 
   
#### The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)

In the <em>The Gathering Cloud</em>, I really enjoyed the metaphor of the cloud was used and how the form and content interact– a digital poem critiquing the environmental impact of digital technologies. The piece has an analogue quality, with its hand-drawn illustrations and subtle animations, which reminds me of early internet aesthetics. I'm beginning to understand how e-lit prioritizes interaction and engagement over passive reading, implicating the user in the construction of meaning. Digital writing isn't just about reading—it's about exploring, playing, and experiencing the text as dynamic. This work creates a sense of overwhelm, layering text and visual elements in a way that feels immersive rather than purely linear. I'm thinking about how I can incorporate this technique in my final project. 

#### The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)

<em>First Draft of the Revolution</em> by Emily Short is a very effective example of interactive fiction. This piece felt strange to me, and I'm almost hesitant to call it a "text" because of its hybridity– the interactive and 'gamefied' elements. Unlike print fiction, where letters are static, this work asks the reader to actively revise them, altering how the story develops. While I didn't connect with this piece as much because of its fictionalized nature (a genre I don’t write in), I appreciate how it plays with the mechanics of revision and rewriting as part of its storytelling process. The mythical aspects were intriguing, and I liked how just clicking a few buttons could shift the narrative so significantly. The affordances of digital media make this possible in a way that traditional literature cannot. 

#### The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

<em>Shade</em> by Andrew Plotkin was the most intriguing work for me, although I found myself frustrated when I couldn't figure out how to get the character to drink water! After reading "Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin’s Shade" by Jeremy Douglass, I better understand how the narrative unfolds, though I doubt I would have reached the ending on my own. The illusion of reality dissolving is both brutal and beautiful, forcing the reader to reconstruct their understanding of the narrative space. The lack of visuals makes the reader an active participant in world-building, which made me realise that e-lit can operate on an entirely different sensory level than print. The second-person perspective intensifies this effect, further implicating the reader in the unfolding story. This is what makes e-lit so distinct from traditional fiction: it demands more from the reader, requiring participation and interaction rather than just consumption.

### Week 5 Reflection:

This week's Required Reading (Aarseth 1997) unpacks some territory that speak directly to some of the great questions raised in your Case Study presnetations such as "in what sense can a hypertext be a narrative? Is hypertext a literary genre or a literary technique?" It introduces the important concept of "ergotics": "hypertext is not a reconfiguration of narrative but offers an alternative to it, as I try to demonstrate through the concept of ergodics." (p.95)

What do you think of Aarseth's concept? explain how it offer an alternative to conventional ideas of narrative and the role of reader and writer?
Regarding our discussion about new terms and concents for thinking beyond binaries: author/reader text/audience ficion/fact etc, and genres or 'silos': novel, poetry, essay, memoir, literature, art, game etc

deleuze and the 'rhizome' from Wikipedia I will add an optional extended reading for anyone interesting in this idea
